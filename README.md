# Mapsplore
A matching-app for adventurous gamers

## Project Description
This is a matching app for gamers who love to explore worlds. They can choose different characteristics they want their world to have and then get a couple suggestions. They can choose what time the world should be in (past, present or future), the season (winter, spring, summer or fall), the envoirement( e.g. sky, sea, forest, etc.) and also the size of the map. With every preference the system will check the database for matches and the best match will come forward. 

## Feature 
I'm not going to be focussing on the worlds that much because I'm not a game developer, but instead my focus is gonna be on the the form where the gamers can input their preferences. How can I match their input with the data from the data base.
