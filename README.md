A matching-app for VR-Gamers

## Project Description
This is a matching app for VR-Gamers who love to explore worlds. They can choose different characteristics they want their world to have and then get a couple suggestions. They can choose what time the world should be in (e.g. the year 1000 b.c. or the year 3500), but also the time of the day (do they want it to be real time or always night). They can also choose landscape. Think about mountains, buildings, maybe caves or oceans. And last but not least, the seasons. With every preference the system will create a new world you can explore and when you like it you can add it to your favorites. 

## Feature 
The Feature I am gonna be focussing on is the form where the gamers can input their preferences.
